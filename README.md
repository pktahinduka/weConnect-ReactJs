## Libraries
[React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - The most popular front-end framework, rebuilt for React.

[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

[Light Bootstrap Dashboard React by Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/) - The Light Bootstrap Dashboard with React is built on top of Bootstrap 3, so you can safely use it on your existing or new Bootstrap project. No line of code from Bootstrap 3 was changed, so you don't have to worry about undesired effects in your work.
